# Asset credits & provenance

Policy (M15_SCOPE.md): every file under `assets/` gets a line here in the same commit that
adds it — source, method, date. If the game is ever published on a storefront (itch.io,
Steam), AI-generated assets must be disclosed at submission per store policy.

## Batch 1 — M15 art pilot (2026-07-17)
All generated with Google Gemini (image generation) by Ben Simpson, from prompts in
`M15_ART_PILOT.md`, style-anchored to `raw_hero_knight_v3.png`:

- `raw/raw_hero_knight_v1.png` — knight, detailed style (superseded; kept for the A/B record)
- `raw/raw_hero_knight_v2.png` — knight, chunky monochrome (superseded; kept for the A/B record)
- `raw/raw_hero_knight_v3.png` — knight, chunky + color — **the style anchor**
- `raw/raw_enemy_goblin_brute.png` — goblin brute (consistency test vs the anchor: passed)
- `raw/raw_bg_battlefield_v1.png` — battlefield backdrop (square; band-cropped in pipeline)
- `raw/raw_ui_frame.png` — UI panel frame (square; sliced as CSS border-image)
